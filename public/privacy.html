<h1>BroncoCast Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>FRC Team 1987 The Broncobots takes the privacy of our students, parents, and mentors very seriously.  Our privacy policy can be summarized in one sentence.  Any information we collect is carefully protected and is only shared with coaches and adults on the team that need to send out announcements.  For the long version, keep reading.</p>

<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We only collect your first and last name, your email address, and your mobile phone number.  When you created your BroncoCast account, the network address of the device was stored in a log on the server but is not associated with your personal information.</p>

<h2>How We Use Information We Collect and Receive</h2>

<p>Your name, email address, and phone number are used to send BroncoCasts (email and text message announcements).  That information is used in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Send BroncoCasts to your email address and phone number</li>
    <li>Administer and maintain the BroncoCast service</li>
    <li>Respond to problem reports or technical support issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Sharing</h2>

<p>Simply put, personal information we collect is not shared outside the Broncobots organization.  Within our organization, only authorized coaches and team leaders can access that personal information.</p>

<p>Broncocast uses an outside service to deliver emails and SMS text messages.  It is necessary to share your email address and/or phone number with these services to facilitate delivery of the BroncoCasts.  Your name is never shared with these services.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
